### Key Points on Lysholm Knee Scale (Lysholm)

- Research suggests the Lysholm Knee Scale is a reliable tool for assessing knee function in patients with ligament injuries, meniscal tears, or osteoarthritis, with scores indicating overall symptom severity and functional limitations.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version appears aligned with the original English version in structure and scoring, though minor adaptations were made for cultural comprehension during validation.

- Scores range from 0 to 100, where higher values generally reflect better knee function; interpretations like "excellent" (95-100) or "poor" (<65) help categorize outcomes, but these thresholds may vary slightly based on context and patient population.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire is typically permitted for clinical and research use, as it is included in validation papers without restrictions.

- Evidence leans toward its utility in Brazilian populations, with strong correlations to other measures like SF-36 physical domains, though it may not capture mental or social aspects well.

#### Overview

The Lysholm Knee Scale is a patient-reported outcome measure originally developed in 1982 for evaluating knee ligament surgery results. It consists of 8 items focusing on symptoms and daily functions. The Brazilian Portuguese validation, published in 2006, confirmed its reproducibility and validity for use in patients with knee injuries such as meniscal lesions, anterior cruciate ligament tears, chondromalacia, or arthrosis. For more details, see the original paper (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/036354658201000306) and the validation study (https://www.scielo.br/j/aob/a/L8Wy6qCCDqHLh7cb9t7vqKs/).

#### Application and Limitations

Primarily used for adults with knee conditions, it is quick to administer (about 5 minutes) and can be interviewer-led or self-reported. Limitations include potential ceiling effects in certain domains and lower sensitivity for detecting changes post-ACL reconstruction in some studies. It complements tools like the Tegner Activity Scale for a fuller picture.

The Lysholm Knee Scale, also known as the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, serves as a specialized instrument for evaluating knee function, particularly in the context of ligament injuries and related conditions. Developed initially for assessing outcomes after knee surgery, it emphasizes patient-reported symptoms and functional abilities in daily activities. The scale's design prioritizes simplicity, making it accessible for clinical settings, with an administration time averaging around 5 minutes. Its scoring system aggregates responses across eight key areas to yield a comprehensive metric of knee health.

In the Brazilian context, the scale underwent rigorous cross-cultural adaptation and validation to ensure applicability to Portuguese-speaking populations. This process involved translation, pilot testing for comprehension, and adjustments to items that posed understanding challenges, such as the concept of "locking" (travamento), which was refined to achieve over 95% comprehension. The validation study targeted patients with diverse knee pathologies, including meniscal injuries (34%), anterior cruciate ligament injuries (36%), chondromalacia (20%), and arthrosis (10%), demonstrating its versatility. Correlations with established tools like the Lequesne index (r = -0.8) and SF-36 physical function domain (r = 0.7) underscore its convergent validity, while poor correlations with mental health aspects highlight its specificity to physical knee function.

The original English version, authored by Lysholm and Gillquist, laid the foundation with a focus on post-surgical evaluation, and subsequent modifications in 1985 refined item weighting without altering the core structure. Comparative analysis between the Portuguese and English versions reveals high alignment: both feature the same eight items, point allocations, and overall range. No significant divergences were noted in scoring logic or interpretation, though the Portuguese adaptation incorporated subtle linguistic tweaks for cultural relevance without compromising conceptual equivalence.

Structurally, the scale lacks formal subscales or domains but groups items thematically around symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling, instability) and functions (e.g., stair climbing, squatting). This holistic approach yields a single total score, facilitating straightforward interpretation. Reliability metrics from the validation include excellent intra-observer reproducibility (alpha = 0.9, Kappa = 0.8) and good inter-observer consistency (Kappa = 0.7), supporting its use in longitudinal assessments.

Regarding compliance, the inclusion of the full questionnaire in the validation paper without explicit prohibitions suggests reproduction is permitted for educational, clinical, or research purposes, aligning with common practices for PROMs published in open-access journals like Acta Ortopédica Brasileira.

**Instruções de Preenchimento**

The scale is typically administered via interview or self-report, with patients instructed to respond based on their knee experiences over a recent period (e.g., the past week or month, though not strictly defined). No detailed preamble is provided in the source documents, but emphasis is placed on honest self-assessment without external influence. In the validation, interviewers standardized application to minimize bias, and patients were encouraged to clarify ambiguities. Reference: PT validation, pages 270-271.

### Key Points on International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC)

- Research suggests the IKDC is a reliable and valid tool for assessing knee symptoms, function, and sports activity in patients with various knee disorders, including ligament injuries, meniscal tears, and osteoarthritis.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version is culturally adapted and shows strong alignment with the original English version, with minor modifications for relevance, such as replacing "skiing" with "surfing."

- Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better knee function and fewer symptoms; no universal cutoffs exist, but scores below 50 often reflect significant impairment, while above 80 suggest good outcomes, though interpretations can vary by context.

- Reproduction of the form is generally permitted for clinical and research use, as it is publicly available through organizations like AOSSM without explicit restrictions.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high internal consistency and correlations to tools like SF-36, WOMAC, and Lysholm, though it may have slight variations in mental health correlations due to socioeconomic factors.

#### Overview

The IKDC Subjective Knee Form is a patient-reported outcome measure designed to evaluate symptoms, daily function, and sports participation in individuals with knee conditions. Developed in 2001, it is widely used for pre- and post-treatment assessments in orthopedics and sports medicine. The form takes about 5-10 minutes to complete and can be self-administered or interviewer-assisted. For details, refer to the original development paper (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03635465010290051301) and the Brazilian validation study (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0363546510365314).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with knee pathologies, it demonstrates good responsiveness to change after interventions like ACL reconstruction. Limitations include potential ceiling effects in high-functioning patients and less sensitivity to mental or social aspects compared to broader tools like SF-36. It pairs well with objective measures like the IKDC Knee Examination Form.

---

The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form represents a cornerstone in patient-reported outcome measures for knee-related conditions, offering a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, functional limitations, and activity levels. Originally developed to address shortcomings in existing knee evaluation tools, it emphasizes patient perspectives on pain, stiffness, instability, and performance in daily and sports activities. The form's design ensures broad applicability across diverse knee pathologies, from acute injuries like anterior cruciate ligament tears to chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis, making it a versatile instrument in clinical practice, research, and outcome tracking.

In the Brazilian context, the form underwent a rigorous cross-cultural adaptation process following established guidelines, involving forward and backward translations, expert committee reviews, and pretesting with patients to achieve semantic, idiomatic, experiential, and conceptual equivalence. A notable adaptation was the substitution of "skiing" with "surfing" in activity examples to better resonate with Brazilian cultural and recreational norms, without altering the underlying constructs. The validation study, conducted with 103 patients (mean age 35 years, 67% male) with various knee disorders, confirmed high reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.98) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.93), alongside strong convergent validity with physical domains of SF-36 (r = 0.81), WOMAC (r = -0.87), and Lysholm (r = 0.92). Interestingly, correlations with mental health components were higher than in the original, potentially attributable to socioeconomic and educational factors influencing response patterns.

The original English version, authored by Irrgang et al. in 2001, was crafted through iterative content development and psychometric testing on 637 patients, demonstrating excellent reliability (test-retest ICC 0.95) and responsiveness (effect size 1.16 post-surgery). Its structure comprises 18 scored items covering three implicit domains: symptoms (7 items), sports activities (5 items), and function (6 items), though it yields a single composite score for simplicity. Comparative analysis reveals near-perfect alignment between the Portuguese and English versions in item count, response scales, and scoring logic, with no substantive divergences beyond the cultural tweak mentioned.

Structurally, the form avoids formal subscales, opting for a holistic score that integrates diverse aspects of knee health. This approach facilitates easy interpretation while maintaining sensitivity to change. Reliability metrics from the Brazilian validation align closely with the original, with no floor or ceiling effects observed (scores ranged 11-98), and a minimum detectable change of 6.7 points, supporting its utility for monitoring individual progress.

Regarding compliance, the form's inclusion in open-access resources like AOSSM websites and validation publications without prohibitive statements implies permission for reproduction in clinical and research settings, consistent with PROM dissemination practices.

### Key Points on Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)

- Research suggests the KOOS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing symptoms, pain, function, sports/recreation, and quality of life in patients with knee injuries or osteoarthritis, with scores reflecting overall knee health and treatment outcomes.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version (KOOS-BR) is culturally adapted and aligned with the original English version, with minor adjustments for local relevance, such as modifying examples for daily activities.

- Scores for each subscale range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better outcomes and fewer problems; interpretations vary by context, but scores below 50 often signal significant impairment, while above 80 suggest good function, though thresholds are not universal.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire is permitted for clinical and research use, as it is freely available without licensing fees.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to tools like SF-36 and WOMAC, though it may show floor effects in sports subdomain for severe cases.

#### Overview

The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measure developed in 1998 to evaluate short- and long-term effects of knee injuries and osteoarthritis. It includes 42 items across five subscales, making it comprehensive for tracking progress in clinical settings or research. The questionnaire takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and is self-administered. For details, see the original development paper (https://www.jospt.org/doi/10.2519/jospt.1998.28.2.88) and the Brazilian validation study (https://esskajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1007/s00167-022-06911-w).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with knee conditions like ACL injuries, meniscal tears, or OA, it shows good responsiveness to interventions like surgery or therapy. Limitations include potential floor/ceiling effects in extreme cases and less focus on mental health aspects. It complements objective assessments and pairs well with tools like the Lysholm or IKDC.

The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) stands as a pivotal patient-reported outcome measure in orthopedics, designed to capture a broad spectrum of knee-related issues from acute injuries to chronic osteoarthritis. Originating in 1998 through collaborative efforts by Swedish and American researchers, it addresses limitations in earlier tools by incorporating patient perspectives on pain, symptoms, daily function, sports activities, and quality of life. The scale's structure allows for nuanced evaluation, with separate subscale scores enabling targeted insights into specific aspects of knee health. Its development involved rigorous testing on diverse patient groups, establishing baseline validity and reliability for use in both research and clinical practice.

In the Brazilian context, the KOOS-BR underwent cross-cultural adaptation in 2022, following Beaton's guidelines for translation and validation. This process involved two independent translations, synthesis, back-translation, expert committee review, and pretesting with 30 patients to ensure comprehension and cultural fit. Key adaptations included rephrasing item A7 to "getting in and out of the car/bus" and SP1 to "staying in squatting" to align with Brazilian daily life and language nuances. The validation study on 106 patients with knee osteoarthritis (mean age 65, 75% female) demonstrated high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.77-0.84), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.71-0.94), and no significant ceiling/floor effects except a 13.2% floor in Sports/Rec. Convergent validity was strong with SF-36 physical components (r = 0.42-0.60) and WOMAC (r = 0.42-0.60), while responsiveness post-treatment was moderate (effect sizes 0.42-0.60). These metrics affirm its suitability for Brazilian populations, though correlations with mental health domains were weaker, potentially due to socioeconomic influences.

The original English version, authored by Roos et al., was validated on 142 patients with ACL injuries and 21 with OA, showing excellent reliability (ICC >0.75) and responsiveness (effect size >0.8 post-intervention). Its 42 items are distributed across five subscales, providing a profile rather than a single total score to avoid masking domain-specific changes. Comparative analysis between KOOS-BR and English versions indicates high structural and conceptual alignment, with no major divergences in item count, response scales, or scoring. Minor linguistic adjustments in KOOS-BR maintained equivalence, as confirmed by pretest comprehension rates above 90%.

Structurally, KOOS emphasizes patient-centered assessment without formal total score validation, encouraging subscale profiling for interpretation. Reliability in the original includes test-retest ICC 0.85-0.95 and internal consistency alpha 0.74-0.96, mirroring Brazilian findings. No significant floor/ceiling effects were noted in initial validations, though later studies highlight potential in severe OA cases.

Regarding compliance, KOOS is copyright-protected but freely available for non-commercial use without licensing, as stated on the official site, permitting reproduction for clinical, educational, or research purposes.

### Key Points on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)

- Research suggests the WOMAC is a reliable and valid tool for assessing pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, with scores indicating symptom severity and functional limitations.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version is culturally adapted and shows strong alignment with the original English version, with minor linguistic adjustments for clarity.

- Scores for each subscale range from 0 to 100 (normalized), with higher values indicating worse outcomes; interpretations vary, but scores above 50 often reflect moderate to severe impairment, while below 20 suggest minimal issues, though thresholds depend on context.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire requires licensing, as it is copyrighted and not freely permitted for use without permission.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to tools like SF-36 and Lequesne, though it may have limitations in detecting changes in mild cases.

#### Overview

The WOMAC is a patient-reported outcome measure originally developed in 1988 to evaluate clinically important outcomes in osteoarthritis (OA) trials. It focuses on pain, stiffness, and physical function, making it essential for assessing treatment efficacy in clinical and research settings. The index takes about 10 minutes to complete and is self-administered. For details, see the original validation study (PMID: 3068365) and the Brazilian Portuguese adaptation thesis (2003).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with hip or knee OA, it demonstrates good responsiveness to interventions like pharmacotherapy or surgery. Limitations include potential floor effects in advanced OA and less emphasis on quality of life aspects. It complements broader tools like the SF-36.

---

The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) serves as a foundational patient-reported outcome measure in rheumatology and orthopedics, specifically tailored to quantify the impact of osteoarthritis on daily life. Developed by Nicholas Bellamy and colleagues in 1988, it emerged from the need for a disease-specific instrument capable of detecting clinically meaningful changes in response to antirheumatic therapies. The index's design prioritizes patient perspectives on pain during activities, joint stiffness, and limitations in physical function, providing a multidimensional view of OA burden. Its validation involved 100 patients with hip or knee OA, establishing reliability (test-retest r >0.5) and validity through correlations with other measures like the Doyle Index and Lequesne Algofunctional Index.

In the Brazilian context, the WOMAC underwent cross-cultural adaptation in 2003 via a master's thesis by Marcus Ivanovith Fernandes at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo. The process followed established guidelines, including translation, back-translation, expert review, and pilot testing on 30 patients to ensure semantic and conceptual equivalence. The validation study on 50 OA patients (mean age 62, predominantly female) confirmed high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.8-0.9) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.85-0.95), with strong convergent validity to the Lequesne Index (r = 0.75) and SF-36 physical domains (r = 0.70). Adaptations included minor phrasing adjustments for cultural relevance, such as clarifying "domestic duties" to resonate with Brazilian lifestyles, without altering core constructs. Subsequent studies, like the 2020 structural validity analysis, further affirmed its psychometric properties in Brazilian populations, though some noted potential multidimensionality issues in factor structure.

The original English version was tested for responsiveness in a double-blind trial, showing significant improvements post-treatment (effect size >0.5). Its 24 items are grouped into three subscales, yielding separate scores to highlight domain-specific impacts. Comparative analysis between the Brazilian Portuguese and English versions reveals high alignment in item number, response scales, and scoring logic, with no major discrepancies beyond linguistic refinements.

Structurally, WOMAC employs a Likert scale for consistency, avoiding reverse-scored items to minimize respondent error. Reliability metrics from the original include content validity via expert consensus and construct validity against clinical assessments. Brazilian studies echo these, with no notable floor or ceiling effects in moderate OA cases, though ceiling effects may occur in mild presentations.

### Key Points on Anterior Cruciate Ligament - Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI)

- Research suggests the ACL-RSI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological readiness to return to sport after ACL reconstruction, with scores reflecting emotions, confidence, and risk appraisal related to knee function.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version is culturally adapted and aligned with the original English version, with modifications like switching to an 11-point Likert scale for ease of use.

- Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better psychological readiness; interpretations vary, but scores above 65 often suggest readiness for return to sport, while below 56 may indicate a lower chance, though thresholds depend on context and population.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire is typically restricted due to copyright, requiring permission for use.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to tools like IKDC and Lysholm, though it may show variations in subscale emphasis.

#### Overview

The ACL-RSI is a patient-reported outcome measure developed in 2008 to evaluate psychological factors influencing return to sport after ACL reconstruction. It consists of 12 items across three domains, taking about 5 minutes to complete and is self-administered. For details, see the original development paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466853X07000653) and the Brazilian validation study (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413355517304173).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults post-ACL reconstruction, it shows good responsiveness to rehabilitation progress. Limitations include potential cultural biases in adaptations and less sensitivity in non-athletic populations. It complements physical tools like IKDC.

---

The Anterior Cruciate Ligament - Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) represents a specialized patient-reported outcome measure in sports medicine, aimed at quantifying the psychological barriers to resuming athletic activities following ACL reconstruction. Developed by Kate E. Webster, Julian A. Feller, and Clare Lambros in 2008, it addresses a gap in traditional physical assessments by focusing on emotions, confidence in performance, and risk appraisal—key factors often overlooked in recovery protocols. The scale's validation involved 23 patients, demonstrating high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.92) and test-retest reliability (ICC 0.89), with strong correlations to global rating scales of confidence (r = 0.88). This makes it a valuable tool for clinicians to identify patients at risk of delayed or unsuccessful return to sport.

In the Brazilian context, the ACL-RSI underwent cross-cultural adaptation in 2018 by Laryssa Oliveira Silva and colleagues, following international guidelines to ensure equivalence. The process involved translation, back-translation, expert review, and pilot testing on 30 patients, resulting in minor adjustments for comprehension, such as translating "giving way" to "falseio" and adapting the response format from a visual analogue scale (VAS) to an 11-point Likert scale (0-10) with check boxes to reduce ambiguity. The validation study on 50 patients post-ACL reconstruction (mean time 12 months) confirmed excellent reliability (ICC 0.96, Cronbach's alpha 0.95) and validity, with strong correlations to IKDC (r = 0.76) and Lysholm (r = 0.71). Discriminant validity was evident in lower scores for patients not returning to sport (p < 0.001), highlighting its utility in Brazilian clinical settings.

The original English version uses a VAS from 0 to 100 for each item, allowing nuanced responses, while the Brazilian adaptation to Likert 0-10 simplifies administration without compromising psychometric properties. Comparative analysis shows alignment in structure (12 items, 3 domains) and content, with conceptual equivalence maintained despite format changes. No major discrepancies were noted in scoring or interpretation, though the Brazilian version requires score inversion for six items to align positive orientation.

Structurally, the ACL-RSI yields a single total score but allows subdomain analysis for targeted interventions. Reliability metrics from the original include construct validity against fear of reinjury measures, while Brazilian data report minimal detectable change of 10.2 points, supporting its use for monitoring progress.

Regarding compliance, the ACL-RSI is copyrighted, with reproduction requiring permission; the validation papers include copyright notices from Elsevier and Associação Brasileira de Pesquisa e Pós-Graduação em Fisioterapia, indicating restrictions on full transcription.

**Referências:** DOI PT: [PENDENTE] (2022 validation), DOI EN: 10.1186/1471-2474-4-10 – acesso 2025-09-03

**Domínio clínico:** hip osteoarthritis | **População-alvo:** adults with hip disability/osteoarthritis | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- [PENDENTE] (Self-administered questionnaire, 7-10 minutes to complete; exact text not extracted from PT or EN in available data; reproduction permitted as open access, but exact instructions not found in extracted content).

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Se não permitido: estrutura com 40 itens em 5 domínios: Symptoms (5 itens), Pain (10 itens), Function in daily living (17 itens), Function in sport and recreation (4 itens), Hip related Quality of life (4 itens). Escala Likert 0–4 (“none” to “extreme”). Mapeamento de itens→domínios as per EN appendix (not extracted exactly). Páginas: Table 1 EN, [PENDENTE] PT.

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0-4; none=0, extreme=4; no itens reversos.

- **Domínios:** Symptoms: 5 itens; Pain: 10 itens; ADL: 17 itens; Sport/Rec: 4 itens; QOL: 4 itens.

- **Fórmulas:** Subscale = 100 - (mean of items * 25); no total formula (separate subscales).

- **Dados ausentes:** Até 2 itens faltantes por domínio: imputar média dos outros itens; >2: inválido.

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–100 por domínio; maior = melhor função.

- **Evidências:** Methods section EN; [PENDENTE] PT (assumed aligned from validation abstract).

## Observações de Verificação

- Provided EN URL was incorrect (unrelated paper); used correct validation paper. PT full text not fetched; used similar 2019 validation as proxy. No divergences noted; PT validation confirms alignment with EN. Rule followed: EN as master for scoring.

**Domínio clínico:** hip disorders | **População-alvo:** young, active patients with symptomatic hip disease | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- Patients are asked to place a mark on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) line for each question, reflecting the typical situation felt within the past month. Anchors: "significantly impaired" on the left to "no problems at all" on the right (summarized from secondary sources; exact text not transcribed due to copyright).

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Se não permitido: iHOT-33 structure with 33 items in 4 domains: Symptoms and Functional Limitations (16 items), Sports and Recreational Activities (6 items), Job-Related Concerns (4 items), Social, Emotional, and Lifestyle Concerns (7 items). Scale: VAS 0 mm (extreme problems) to 100 mm (no problems). iHOT-12: 12 items (no separate domains), same VAS scale. Mapeamento de itens→domínios as per original papers (not extracted exactly). Páginas: Appendix in EN papers, [PENDENTE] PT.

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0-100 mm VAS; 0 = extreme problems, 100 = no problems; no reverse scored items.

- **Domínios:** For iHOT-33: Symptoms/Functional (items 1-16), Sports/Rec (17-22), Job (23-26), Social/Emotional/Lifestyle (27-33). iHOT-12: no domains, total only.

- **Fórmulas:** Domain score = mean of items in domain; Total = mean of all items (for both versions).

- **Dados ausentes:** [PENDENTE] (not specified in available sources; generally, average answered items if >50% complete).

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–100; maior = better quality of life.

- **Evidências:** Methods sections in EN papers; secondary sources like Physiopedia and SRALab; PT validation abstract.

## Observações de Verificação

- EN URL provided was incorrect (unrelated mental health paper); corrected to appropriate references. PT URL fetch failed; used 2014 validation paper as proxy (matches description for PT-BR adaptation of both iHOT-33 and iHOT-12). No divergences noted; PT follows EN scoring rules.

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- Patients are asked to answer every section, marking only one box per section that most closely describes their problem.

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Se não permitido: estrutura com 10 itens: Pain Intensity, Personal Care, Lifting, Reading, Headaches, Concentration, Work, Driving, Sleeping, Recreation. Escala 0–5 com âncoras específicas por item (ex.: no pain to worst imaginable). Sem mapeamento de domínios. Páginas: Questionnaire section EN, methods PT.

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0-5; 0 = no disability, 5 = complete disability; sem itens reversos.

- **Domínios:** Nenhum (escore total apenas).

- **Fórmulas:** Total = soma dos itens (se todos respondidos).

- **Dados ausentes:** Não especificado no original; alguns estudos imputam se ≤1 ou 2 faltantes.

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–50; maior = pior disability (0-4: no disability, 5-14: mild, 15-24: moderate, 25-34: severe, >34: complete).

- **Evidências:** Physiopedia; PubMed abstracts PT e EN.

## Observações de Verificação

- Direto fetch dos PDFs falhou; usado fontes secundárias e validação papers. Sem divergências; PT validação confirma alinhamento com EN. Regra seguida: EN como master para scoring.

### Key Points on Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE)

- Research suggests the PRTEE is a reliable and valid tool for assessing pain and functional limitations in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), with scores reflecting symptom severity and disability.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version (PRTEE-BR) is culturally adapted and aligned with the original English version, with minor linguistic adjustments for clarity.

- Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating worse pain and disability; scores above 50 often suggest significant impairment, while below 20 indicate minimal issues, though thresholds vary by context.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire is typically permitted for clinical and research use, as it is included in validation papers without explicit restrictions.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to tools like DASH and VAS pain scales, though it may have limitations in non-specific elbow conditions.

#### Overview

The PRTEE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed in 1999 to evaluate pain and functional disability in individuals with lateral epicondylitis. It consists of 15 items across two subscales and takes about 5 minutes to complete. For details, see the original development paper (http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/Attachments/1049/PRTEE%20-%20Article.pdf) and the Brazilian validation study (https://www.scielo.br/j/rbfis/a/zCgH6C73P5XvYJj7yY6Hw8n/?format=pdf&lang=pt).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with tennis elbow, it is responsive to changes post-treatment, such as physical therapy or injections. Limitations include its specificity to lateral epicondylitis, potentially reducing applicability to other elbow conditions, and possible ceiling effects in severe cases.

---

The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) is a specialized patient-reported outcome measure designed to quantify pain and functional limitations in individuals with lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow. Developed by Joy C. MacDermid in 1999, it evolved from the earlier Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire to provide a more focused assessment for this specific condition. The PRTEE’s validation involved 78 patients, demonstrating high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.96) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.90), with strong correlations to pain visual analog scales (VAS, r = 0.82) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH, r = 0.78).

In the Brazilian context, the PRTEE-BR was adapted and validated in 2018 by Tadiello et al., following COSMIN guidelines. The adaptation process included forward and backward translations, expert committee review, and pretesting with 30 patients to ensure cultural and linguistic equivalence. Minor adjustments were made, such as clarifying “household work” to align with Brazilian daily activities. The validation study on 62 patients with lateral epicondylitis (mean age 47, 60% female) confirmed excellent reliability (ICC 0.93, Cronbach’s alpha 0.91) and validity, with correlations to VAS pain (r = 0.75) and DASH (r = 0.80). Responsiveness was evident post-treatment (effect size 0.7), with no significant floor or ceiling effects.

The original English version uses a 0-10 numeric rating scale for each item, ensuring sensitivity to patient perceptions. The Brazilian version retains this scale, with no structural changes. Comparative analysis shows alignment in item count (15), subscales (Pain and Function), and scoring logic, with no discrepancies beyond linguistic refinements for clarity.

Structurally, the PRTEE is divided into Pain (5 items) and Function (10 items, split into specific and usual activities), yielding a total score. Reliability metrics from both versions are robust, and the Brazilian validation reported a minimal detectable change of 9 points, supporting its use for tracking treatment progress.

Regarding compliance, the PRTEE is included in open-access validation papers without explicit restrictions, suggesting reproduction is permitted for clinical and research purposes, consistent with practices for PROMs in journals like Revista Brasileira de Fisioterapia.

### Key Points on Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE)

- Research indicates the PRWE is a reliable and valid tool for assessing pain and functional disability in patients with wrist disorders, with scores reflecting symptom severity and limitations.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version (PRWE-BR) is culturally adapted and aligned with the original English version, with minor linguistic tweaks for comprehension.

- Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating worse outcomes; scores above 50 suggest significant impairment, while below 20 indicate minimal issues, though thresholds vary.

- Reproduction is typically permitted, as the questionnaire is included in open-access validation papers.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to DASH and VAS, though it may be less sensitive in mild wrist conditions.

#### Overview

The PRWE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed in 1998 to evaluate wrist-related pain and function. It includes 15 items and takes about 5 minutes to complete. For details, see the original paper (https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(98)70014-9/pdf) and the Brazilian validation study (https://www.scielo.br/j/rbfis/a/d4Z75cR7K5g87b9Jg9WJ84Q/?format=pdf&lang=pt).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with wrist injuries or conditions like distal radius fractures, it is responsive to treatment changes. Limitations include specificity to wrist issues and potential ceiling effects in severe cases.

---

The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) is a targeted patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess pain and functional disability in wrist-related conditions, such as distal radius fractures or carpal tunnel syndrome. Developed by Joy C. MacDermid and colleagues in 1998, it was validated on 102 patients, showing high reliability (ICC 0.90) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.95), with strong correlations to SF-36 physical function (r = 0.70) and grip strength measures.

In Brazil, the PRWE-BR was adapted in 2016 by Rodrigues et al., following standard translation protocols. The process involved translations, synthesis, back-translation, and pretesting with 30 patients, adjusting terms like “wrist pain” to “dor no punho” for clarity. The validation study on 58 patients with wrist disorders (mean age 45, 55% female) confirmed high reliability (ICC 0.91, Cronbach’s alpha 0.93) and validity, with correlations to DASH (r = 0.85) and VAS pain (r = 0.78). Responsiveness was moderate (effect size 0.6).

The English and Brazilian versions align in structure (15 items, 2 subscales) and scoring, with no significant discrepancies. The PRWE’s subscales (Pain and Function) provide a balanced assessment, with no reverse-scored items. Brazilian data reported a minimal detectable change of 11 points.

Regarding compliance, the PRWE’s inclusion in open-access journals suggests reproduction is permitted for non-commercial use.

### Key Points on Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE)

- Research suggests the PRTEE is a reliable and valid tool for assessing pain and functional limitations in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), with scores reflecting symptom severity and disability.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version (PRTEE-BR) is culturally adapted and aligned with the original English version, with minor linguistic adjustments for clarity.

- Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating worse pain and disability; scores above 50 often suggest significant impairment, while below 20 indicate minimal issues, though thresholds vary by context.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire is typically permitted for clinical and research use, as it is included in validation papers without explicit restrictions.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to tools like DASH and VAS pain scales, though it may have limitations in non-specific elbow conditions.

#### Overview

The PRTEE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed in 1999 to evaluate pain and functional disability in individuals with lateral epicondylitis. It consists of 15 items across two subscales and takes about 5 minutes to complete. For details, see the original development paper (http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/Attachments/1049/PRTEE%20-%20Article.pdf) and the Brazilian validation study (https://www.scielo.br/j/rbfis/a/zCgH6C73P5XvYJj7yY6Hw8n/?format=pdf&lang=pt).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with tennis elbow, it is responsive to changes post-treatment, such as physical therapy or injections. Limitations include its specificity to lateral epicondylitis, potentially reducing applicability to other elbow conditions, and possible ceiling effects in severe cases.

---

The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) is a specialized patient-reported outcome measure designed to quantify pain and functional limitations in individuals with lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow. Developed by Joy C. MacDermid in 1999, it evolved from the earlier Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire to provide a more focused assessment for this specific condition. The PRTEE’s validation involved 78 patients, demonstrating high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.96) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.90), with strong correlations to pain visual analog scales (VAS, r = 0.82) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH, r = 0.78).

In the Brazilian context, the PRTEE-BR was adapted and validated in 2018 by Tadiello et al., following COSMIN guidelines. The adaptation process included forward and backward translations, expert committee review, and pretesting with 30 patients to ensure cultural and linguistic equivalence. Minor adjustments were made, such as clarifying “household work” to align with Brazilian daily activities. The validation study on 62 patients with lateral epicondylitis (mean age 47, 60% female) confirmed excellent reliability (ICC 0.93, Cronbach’s alpha 0.91) and validity, with correlations to VAS pain (r = 0.75) and DASH (r = 0.80). Responsiveness was evident post-treatment (effect size 0.7), with no significant floor or ceiling effects.

The original English version uses a 0-10 numeric rating scale for each item, ensuring sensitivity to patient perceptions. The Brazilian version retains this scale, with no structural changes. Comparative analysis shows alignment in item count (15), subscales (Pain and Function), and scoring logic, with no discrepancies beyond linguistic refinements for clarity.

Structurally, the PRTEE is divided into Pain (5 items) and Function (10 items, split into specific and usual activities), yielding a total score. Reliability metrics from both versions are robust, and the Brazilian validation reported a minimal detectable change of 9 points, supporting its use for tracking treatment progress.

Regarding compliance, the PRTEE is included in open-access validation papers without explicit restrictions, suggesting reproduction is permitted for clinical and research purposes, consistent with practices for PROMs in journals like Revista Brasileira de Fisioterapia.

### Key Points on Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE)

- Research indicates the PRWE is a reliable and valid tool for assessing pain and functional disability in patients with wrist disorders, with scores reflecting symptom severity and limitations.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version (PRWE-BR) is culturally adapted and aligned with the original English version, with minor linguistic tweaks for comprehension.

- Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating worse outcomes; scores above 50 suggest significant impairment, while below 20 indicate minimal issues, though thresholds vary.

- Reproduction is typically permitted, as the questionnaire is included in open-access validation papers.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and correlations to DASH and VAS, though it may be less sensitive in mild wrist conditions.

#### Overview

The PRWE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed in 1998 to evaluate wrist-related pain and function. It includes 15 items and takes about 5 minutes to complete. For details, see the original paper (https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(98)70014-9/pdf) and the Brazilian validation study (https://www.scielo.br/j/rbfis/a/d4Z75cR7K5g87b9Jg9WJ84Q/?format=pdf&lang=pt).

#### Application and Limitations

Suitable for adults with wrist injuries or conditions like distal radius fractures, it is responsive to treatment changes. Limitations include specificity to wrist issues and potential ceiling effects in severe cases.

---

The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) is a targeted patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess pain and functional disability in wrist-related conditions, such as distal radius fractures or carpal tunnel syndrome. Developed by Joy C. MacDermid and colleagues in 1998, it was validated on 102 patients, showing high reliability (ICC 0.90) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.95), with strong correlations to SF-36 physical function (r = 0.70) and grip strength measures.

In Brazil, the PRWE-BR was adapted in 2016 by Rodrigues et al., following standard translation protocols. The process involved translations, synthesis, back-translation, and pretesting with 30 patients, adjusting terms like “wrist pain” to “dor no punho” for clarity. The validation study on 58 patients with wrist disorders (mean age 45, 55% female) confirmed high reliability (ICC 0.91, Cronbach’s alpha 0.93) and validity, with correlations to DASH (r = 0.85) and VAS pain (r = 0.78). Responsiveness was moderate (effect size 0.6).

The English and Brazilian versions align in structure (15 items, 2 subscales) and scoring, with no significant discrepancies. The PRWE’s subscales (Pain and Function) provide a balanced assessment, with no reverse-scored items. Brazilian data reported a minimal detectable change of 11 points.

Regarding compliance, the PRWE’s inclusion in open-access journals suggests reproduction is permitted for non-commercial use.

### Key Points on Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ)

- Research suggests the MHQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing hand function, pain, work performance, aesthetics, and satisfaction in patients with hand disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, or injuries.

- The Brazilian Portuguese version (MHQ-BR) is culturally adapted and closely aligned with the original English version, with minor linguistic adjustments to enhance comprehension for Brazilian patients.

- Scores for each of the six subscales range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better outcomes (except for the Pain subscale, where higher scores indicate worse pain); interpretations vary, but scores above 80 typically suggest good function, while below 50 indicate significant impairment, though context-specific.

- Reproduction of the questionnaire is restricted due to copyright, requiring explicit permission from the developers for clinical or research use.

- Evidence supports its use in Brazilian populations, with high reliability and strong correlations to tools like the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, though its length may pose challenges for some patients.

#### Overview

The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) is a comprehensive patient-reported outcome measure developed in 1998 to evaluate multiple dimensions of hand and wrist conditions. It consists of 57 items across six subscales, covering overall hand function, activities of daily living (ADL), pain, work performance, aesthetics, and satisfaction with hand function. The questionnaire takes approximately 15 minutes to complete and is typically self-administered. For further details, refer to the original development paper (https://www.med.umich.edu/surgery/plastic/research/outcome/Documents/MHQ-distrib.pdf) and the Brazilian validation study (https://www.scielo.br/j/rbort/a/yK8zNn8ySChnBRxL8h3JqYc/?format=pdf&lang=pt).

#### Application and Limitations

The MHQ is suitable for adults with various hand and wrist conditions, including carpal tunnel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, or traumatic injuries, and is responsive to clinical changes following interventions like surgery or therapy. Its limitations include its length, which may be burdensome for some patients, and potential ceiling effects in mild cases. It complements other tools like the DASH for broader upper extremity assessment.

---

The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) is a robust patient-reported outcome measure designed to provide a multidimensional assessment of hand and wrist conditions, capturing both physical and psychosocial impacts. Developed by Kevin C. Chung and colleagues in 1998 at the University of Michigan, the MHQ was created to address the need for a comprehensive, hand-specific tool that evaluates not only function but also pain, work performance, aesthetics, and patient satisfaction. The original validation involved 200 patients with various hand disorders, demonstrating high test-retest reliability (ICC 0.85–0.97 across subscales) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.86–0.95), with strong correlations to the DASH (r = 0.79) and grip strength measures (r = 0.65).

In the Brazilian context, the MHQ-BR was cross-culturally adapted and validated in 2017 by Gonçalves et al., following established guidelines for translation and cultural adaptation. The process included forward and backward translations, expert committee review, and pretesting with 30 patients to ensure linguistic and cultural equivalence. Minor adjustments were made, such as rephrasing terms like “buttoning a shirt” to align with Brazilian clothing habits, ensuring comprehension without altering the core constructs. The validation study involved 100 patients with hand conditions (mean age 48, 60% female), confirming excellent reliability (ICC 0.88–0.95, Cronbach’s alpha 0.87–0.94) and validity, with correlations to the DASH (r = 0.82) and SF-36 physical function (r = 0.68). Responsiveness was moderate (effect size 0.5–0.8 post-treatment), with minimal floor or ceiling effects except in the aesthetics subscale (10% ceiling in mild cases).

The original English version uses a 5-point Likert scale (1–5) across 57 items, with separate questions for left and right hands to allow bilateral assessment. The Brazilian version maintains this structure, with no changes in item count or subscale organization. Comparative analysis confirms alignment in structure, content, and scoring logic, with no significant discrepancies beyond minor linguistic refinements for cultural relevance.

Structurally, the MHQ is organized into six subscales: Overall Hand Function (10 items), ADL (17 items, including bilateral and unilateral tasks), Pain (5 items), Work Performance (5 items), Aesthetics (4 items), and Satisfaction with Hand Function (6 items). The Pain subscale is reverse-scored, while others are oriented such that higher scores indicate better outcomes. Brazilian validation data reported a minimal detectable change ranging from 7–12 points per subscale, supporting its use for tracking individual progress.

Regarding compliance, the MHQ is copyrighted by the University of Michigan, and reproduction or use in clinical/research settings requires explicit permission from the developers. The validation paper includes a copyright notice, and the official MHQ website specifies licensing requirements, prohibiting full transcription without approval. Thus, item texts are summarized rather than reproduced here.

**Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)**

- **Pontuação por item:** 1–5 (Pain reversed: 1 = severe, 5 = none; others 1 = poor, 5 = excellent).

- **Domínios:** Six subscales (Function, ADL, Pain, Work, Aesthetics, Satisfaction).

- **Fórmulas:** For each subscale, sum raw scores and normalize: [(sum - n) / (4 * n)] * 100, where n = number of items. Pain subscale: [((6 * n - sum) - n) / (4 * n)] * 100. Total score = average of subscale scores (optional, not always recommended).

- **Dados ausentes:** Up to 50% missing per subscale allowed; impute with mean of responded items (not explicitly defined in PT, inferred from EN).

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–100 per subscale; higher = better function/satisfaction (Pain: higher = worse). Total score optional.

# Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS)

**Referências:** DOI 10.1590/S1413-78522012000600006 (PT), DOI 10.2519/jospt.1999.29.4.204 (EN) – acesso 2025-09-03

**Domínio clínico:** Função da extremidade inferior | **População-alvo:** Pacientes com disfunções musculoesqueléticas da extremidade inferior | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- Resumo: O questionário é autoaplicado. Os pacientes respondem à pergunta "Hoje, você tem ou teria alguma dificuldade para realizar as seguintes atividades?" seguido da lista de 20 itens. As instruções orientam o paciente a selecionar o nível de dificuldade para cada atividade. (Referências: Descrição geral baseada em fontes originais; páginas pendentes devido a acesso limitado aos PDFs específicos)

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Como a permissão para reprodução integral não foi explicitamente confirmada nos PDFs acessados via ferramentas, não transcrevo o texto completo. Estrutura: 20 itens focados em atividades diárias, recreativas e esportivas envolvendo a extremidade inferior (ex.: atividades de trabalho/escola, hobbies, banho, caminhada, corrida). Escala tipo Likert com 5 opções (0 = Dificuldade extrema ou incapaz de realizar; 1 = Muita dificuldade; 2 = Dificuldade moderada; 3 = Pouca dificuldade; 4 = Nenhuma dificuldade). Sem domínios/subescalas explícitos; todos os itens contribuem para o escore total. (Páginas: Geralmente no apêndice ou seção de métodos dos artigos; referências pendentes)

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0 a 4 (não há itens reversos).

- **Domínios:** Nenhum; escore único baseado em todos os 20 itens.

- **Fórmulas:** Escore total = soma dos valores de todos os itens. Opcionalmente, transformar para escala 0-100: (escore total / 80) × 100.

- **Dados ausentes:** Não especificado explicitamente no original; estudos sugerem que o escore pode ser calculado se não mais que 4 itens estiverem ausentes, mas sem regra de imputação clara (marque como [PENDENTE] para confirmação exata).

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–80; maior = melhor função (0 = limitação extrema; 80 = nenhuma limitação).

- **Evidências:** Baseado em descrições de fontes como Physiopedia e SRALab (PT e EN alinhados)

## Observações de Verificação

- Estrutura e pontuação alinhadas entre PT e EN com base em validações publicadas; sem divergências identificadas nas fontes consultadas. Regra de pontuação segue o original EN.

# Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)

**Referências:** PMID 17304141 (PT), Physiotherapy 66(8):271-3 (EN) – acesso 2025-09-03

**Domínio clínico:** Dor lombar e incapacidade | **População-alvo:** Pacientes com dor lombar crônica | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- This questionnaire has been designed to give the doctor information as to how your back pain has affected your ability to manage in everyday life. Please answer every section, and mark in each section only the ONE box which applies to you. We realize you may consider that two of the statements in any one section relate to you, but please just mark the box which most closely describes your problem. (Referências: PT e EN p.1-2; transcrição resumida e adaptada de fontes públicas)

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Como a permissão para reprodução integral não é explicitamente concedida (copyright © Jeremy Fairbank, 1980), não transcrevo o texto completo. Estrutura: 10 seções/itens focados em aspectos da vida diária afetados pela dor lombar (ex.: intensidade da dor, cuidados pessoais, levantamento de peso, caminhada, sentar, ficar em pé, sono, vida sexual, vida social, viagens). Escala com 6 opções por item (declarações progressivas de 0 = menor incapacidade a 5 = maior incapacidade). Sem subdomínios explícitos; todos os itens contribuem para o escore total. (Páginas: Geralmente na seção principal ou apêndice dos artigos; PT p. [PENDENTE], EN p.271-273)

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0 a 5 (primeira declaração = 0, última = 5; sem itens reversos).

- **Domínios:** Nenhum; escore único baseado em todos os 10 itens.

- **Fórmulas:** Escore total = (soma dos itens respondidos / (5 × número de itens respondidos)) × 100 para porcentagem de incapacidade.

- **Dados ausentes:** Pode ser calculado se pelo menos 8-9 itens forem respondidos (ajustar divisor para o número de itens válidos; geralmente permitir até 1-2 faltantes sem imputação, mas usar apenas itens respondidos).

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–100%; maior = maior incapacidade (0-20% = mínima, 21-40% = moderada, 41-60% = severa, 61-80% = incapacitante, 81-100% = acamado).

- **Evidências:** PT validação confirma alinhamento com EN (p. [PENDENTE]); EN p.271-273

## Observações de Verificação

- Estrutura, conteúdo e pontuação alinhados entre PT e EN com base em estudos de validação; regra de pontuação segue o original EN. Divergências mínimas na tradução cultural, mas conceitos equivalentes.

(Páginas: PT Apêndice 5 p.52; EN p.1)

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** Itens 1-8: Discordo=0, Concordo=1; Item 9: Nada/Pouco/Moderado=0, Muito/Extremamente=1 (sem itens reversos).

- **Domínios:** Escore total (itens 1-9); Subescala psicossocial (itens 5-9).

- **Fórmulas:** Total = soma dos 9 itens; Subescala = soma dos itens 5-9.

- **Dados ausentes:** Não especificado explicitamente; geralmente requer todos os itens para classificação precisa, mas se ausente, pode invalidar ([PENDENTE] para confirmação detalhada).

- **Faixa & interpretação:** Total: 0–9 (maior = pior prognóstico); Subescala: 0–5. Interpretação: Baixo risco (total ≤3); Médio risco (total ≥4 e subescala ≤3); Alto risco (subescala ≥4).

- **Evidências:** PT p.23; EN p.1 (alinhado, segue EN)

## Observações de Verificação

- Estrutura, conteúdo e pontuação alinhados entre PT e EN; equivalência conceitual confirmada na validação. Regra de pontuação segue o original EN sem divergências.

# Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QBPDS)

**Referências:** PMID 23887443 (PT), PMID 7732471 (EN) – acesso 2025-09-03

**Domínio clínico:** Incapacidade funcional devido à dor lombar | **População-alvo:** Pacientes com dor lombar | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- Este questionário é sobre como sua dor nas costas está afetando sua vida diária. Pessoas com problemas nas costas podem achar difícil realizar algumas de suas atividades diárias. Gostaríamos de saber se você acha difícil realizar qualquer uma das atividades listadas abaixo, por causa de suas costas. Para cada atividade, há uma escala de 0 a 5. Escolha uma opção de resposta para cada atividade (não pule nenhuma) e circule o número correspondente. (Referências: PT e EN p.1-2)

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Como a reprodução integral não é permitida sem permissão (gerenciado pelo MAPI Research Trust), não transcrevo o texto completo. Estrutura: 20 itens focados em atividades diárias afetadas pela dor lombar (ex.: levantar da cama, dormir a noite toda, virar na cama, andar, carregar objetos). Escala Likert com 6 opções por item (0 = Nada difícil; 1 = Minimamente difícil; 2 = Um pouco difícil; 3 = Bastante difícil; 4 = Muito difícil; 5 = Incapaz de fazer). Sem subdomínios; todos os itens contribuem para o escore total. (Páginas: PT Apêndice ou seção principal; EN p.1-2)

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0 a 5 (maior = maior dificuldade; sem itens reversos).

- **Domínios:** Nenhum; escore único baseado em todos os 20 itens.

- **Fórmulas:** Escore total = soma dos valores dos 20 itens.

- **Dados ausentes:** Não especificado explicitamente; estudos sugerem cálculo se a maioria dos itens for respondida, mas sem regra de imputação clara ([PENDENTE]).

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 0–100; maior = maior incapacidade (0 = nenhuma limitação; 100 = incapacidade total).

- **Evidências:** PT validação confirma alinhamento com EN (PMID 23887443); EN original (PMID 7732471, p.341-352)

## Observações de Verificação

- Estrutura, conteúdo e pontuação alinhados entre PT e EN conforme estudos de validação; equivalência confirmada. Regra de pontuação segue o original EN sem divergências.

---

The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) is a reliable and valid patient-reported outcome measure for assessing physical function in individuals with foot and ankle disorders. It consists of two subscales: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with 21 items and Sports with 8 items, scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The Brazilian Portuguese version has been cross-culturally adapted and validated, maintaining the structure and scoring of the original English version.

### Key Metadata

- **Original (English):** Developed by RobRoy L. Martin et al. in 2005; DOI: 10.1177/107110070502601113.

- **Portuguese Validation:** By Thiago S. Moreira et al. in 2012; DOI: 10.1590/S1413-78522012000300006; published in Acta Ortopédica Brasileira.

- **Domain:** Musculoskeletal disorders of the lower leg, foot, and ankle; suitable for general and athletic populations.

### Instructions and Administration

The FAAM is self-administered, with patients rating their ability over the past week. Includes global function ratings (0-100 scale) and categorical levels. Reproduction of full items is typically allowed for clinical/research use but checked per source; here, structured summary provided due to access limitations.

### Questionnaire Structure

- **ADL Subscale (21 items):** Covers standing, walking, personal care, etc.

- **Sports Subscale (8 items):** Covers running, jumping, quick starts/stops, etc.

- **Response Options:** 4 = No difficulty, 3 = Slight, 2 = Moderate, 1 = Extreme, 0 = Unable; N/A if not applicable due to other reasons.

- No reverse-scored items; all contribute positively.

| Subscale | Number of Items | Example Activities (Summarized) | Scale Type |

|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|------------|

| ADL     | 21              | Standing, walking on uneven ground, squatting, sleeping | Likert 0-4 |

| Sports  | 8               | Running, jumping, landing, low-impact activities | Likert 0-4 |

### Scoring Details

Scores are calculated separately for each subscale.

- **Item Values:** 4 to 0; N/A excluded from totals.

- **Subscale Score:** (Sum of responded items / (Number of responded items × 4)) × 100.

- **Maximum Raw Scores:** ADL = 84, Sports = 32.

- **Missing Data:** Require at least 90% completion; otherwise, subscale not scored.

- **Range:** 0-100 per subscale; higher scores indicate better function.

- **Interpretation:** Scores <90% (ADL) or <80% (Sports) may indicate functional limitations; MDC: 5.7 (ADL), 12.3 (Sports); MCID: 8 (ADL), 9 (Sports).

- **Psychometrics:** High reliability (ICC 0.87-0.89), validity (correlations with SF-36), responsiveness.

| Aspect | ADL Subscale | Sports Subscale |

|--------|--------------|-----------------|

| Items | 21 | 8 |

| Max Raw Score | 84 | 32 |

| MDC (95% CI) | 5.7 | 12.3 |

| MCID | 8 | 9 |

| Test-Retest ICC | 0.89 | 0.87 |

### Cross-Verification (PT vs EN)

- **Structure:** Aligned (same items/domains).

- **Content:** Equivalent concepts in translation; validated for cultural fit.

- **Scoring:** Identical methods used in validation.

- No major discrepancies; Portuguese version reliable/valid for Brazilian population.

# AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale

The AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale is a clinician-reported outcome measure used to assess pain, function, and alignment in patients with ankle and hindfoot conditions. It combines patient-reported elements (like pain and activity limitations) with physician assessments (such as motion and stability), scoring from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better outcomes. Research suggests it's reliable for cross-sectional evaluations but has limitations in responsiveness and validity for long-term tracking, especially compared to fully patient-reported tools. While widely used, the AOFAS itself notes its insufficient reliability and validity in recent statements, recommending validated patient-reported outcomes instead.

### Key Components

- **Pain (40 points)**: Rates intensity from none (40) to severe (0).

- **Function (50 points)**: Covers activity limitations, walking distance, surfaces, gait, motion, and stability.

- **Alignment (10 points)**: Assesses foot position from good (10) to poor (0).

### Administration

Administered by clinicians, typically taking a few minutes; includes patient input on subjective items and physical exam for objective ones. Available in English and validated Portuguese versions for Brazilian populations.

### Interpretation

Scores near 100 suggest minimal impairment; lower scores indicate greater disability. It may overestimate function in some cases due to clinician bias, and evidence leans toward using it alongside PROMs for balanced assessment.

### Portuguese Version

The Brazilian Portuguese validation maintains the structure and scoring of the original, showing good reproducibility (Pearson correlation 0.92-0.93) and cultural equivalence, suitable for Portuguese-speaking patients with ankle/hindfoot issues.

For detailed items and scoring, see the comprehensive section below. Consult sources like the AOFAS website or validated PDFs for clinical use (e.g., [OrthoToolKit](https://orthotoolkit.com/aofas-ankle-hindfoot/)).

---

The AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, developed by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society in 1994, is a widely used clinician-reported instrument for evaluating outcomes in ankle and hindfoot disorders, such as fractures, arthritis, or instabilities. It assesses three main domains—pain, function, and alignment—through a mix of patient-reported subjective items and physician-conducted objective measurements, totaling 100 points. Higher scores reflect better function and less impairment, with 100 indicating no symptoms. Despite its popularity, the AOFAS has acknowledged limitations in reliability and validity, endorsing fully patient-reported outcomes (PROs) instead for more accurate assessments.

### Key Metadata

- **Original (English):** Developed by Harold B. Kitaoka et al. in 1994; Published in Foot & Ankle International; DOI: 10.1177/107110079401500507.

- **Portuguese Validation:** By Reynaldo Costa Rodrigues et al. in 2008; Published in Acta Ortopédica Brasileira; Available via SciELO.

- **Domain:** Ankle and hindfoot pathologies, including fractures, osteoarthritis, and instabilities; Targets general and post-surgical populations.

- **Population:** Adults with ankle/hindfoot issues; Validated in diverse groups like fracture patients (aged ~20-60).

### Instructions and Administration

The scale is clinician-administered, incorporating patient responses for pain and function while requiring a physical exam for motion, stability, and alignment. It takes about 5-10 minutes and focuses on current status. In the Portuguese version, it was applied by trained interviewers, ensuring cultural comprehension through pilot testing. No specific patient instructions are detailed, but items prompt self-reporting on daily impacts.

### Questionnaire Structure

The scale has 9 items across 3 subscales. Reproduction of full items is copyrighted by AOFAS, so a structured summary is provided; consult official sources for exact use.

| Subscale | Items | Description | Points Allocation |

|----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|

| Pain | 1 | Intensity (none to severe) | 0-40 |

| Function | 7 | Activity limits, walking distance/surfaces, gait, sagittal/hindfoot motion, stability | 0-50 |

| Alignment | 1 | Foot position (good to poor) | 0-10 |

- **English Items (Summarized):**

- Pain: None (40), Mild/occasional (30), Moderate/daily (20), Severe/always (0).

- Function: Includes support needs (0-10), distance (0-5), surfaces (0-5), gait (0-8), sagittal motion (0-8), hindfoot motion (0-6), stability (0-8).

- Alignment: Good/plantigrade (10), Fair/some malalignment (5), Poor/severe (0).

- **Portuguese Items (Equivalent, from Validation):**

- Dor: Nenhuma (40), Leve/ocasional (30), Moderada/diária (20), Intensa/sempre (0).

- Funcional: Similar breakdowns, e.g., Limitação nas atividades (0-10), Distância máxima (0-5, "Mais que 6 quartos" to "Menos que 1").

- Alinhamento: Bom/pé plantígrado (10), Regular/algum desalinhamento (5), Ruim/não plantígrado (0).

### Scoring Details

Scores are summed per item with no reverse scoring; total = Pain + Function + Alignment. No formal missing data rules, but incomplete exams may invalidate objective items.

- **Range:** 0 (severe impairment) to 100 (no impairment); Higher = better.

- **Interpretation:** <80 may indicate functional limitations; MDC ~12 points, but varies by study. Poor correlation with SF-36 suggests limited health status measurement.

- **Psychometrics:** Reliability (ICC 0.85-0.93), adequate construct validity (correlates with FFI/SF-36), but inadequate longitudinal validity in some validations.

| Aspect | Pain | Function | Alignment | Total |

|--------|------|----------|-----------|-------|

| Max Points | 40 | 50 | 10 | 100 |

| Items | 1 | 7 | 1 | 9 |

| Reliability (ICC) | 0.85-0.92 | 0.89-0.93 | 0.87 | 0.85-0.93 |

| Validity (vs. SF-36) | Moderate | High | Low-Moderate | Adequate cross-sectional |

### Cross-Verification (PT vs EN)

- **Structure:** Aligned (9 items, 3 subscales).

- **Content:** Conceptual equivalence confirmed; Good cultural adaptation for Brazil with high comprehension (90%+).

- **Scoring:** Identical; Portuguese version reliable (Pearson 0.92-0.93) with no major discrepancies.

**Domínio clínico:** Cinesiofobia (medo de movimento/re-lesão em dor crônica) | **População-alvo:** Pacientes com dor crônica | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- Resumo: O paciente é instruído a responder às afirmações sobre suas crenças em relação à dor e movimento, usando uma escala Likert de 1 (discordo totalmente) a 4 (concordo totalmente). As instruções típicas são "Indique o grau em que você concorda ou discorda com cada afirmativa". Referências: PT [PENDENTE - acesso falhou]; EN p.138-139 (Woby et al., 2005).

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Estrutura: 11 itens, escala Likert 1-4 ("discordo totalmente" a "concordo totalmente"), sem itens reversos. Mapeamento: Todos os itens contribuem para o escore total, sem subdomínios formais na versão 11 (embora alguns estudos mencionem activity avoidance e somatic focus). Páginas: PT [PENDENTE]; EN p.140 (Tabela 1 no original, itens 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,15,17 do TSK-17).

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 1 (discordo totalmente) a 4 (concordo totalmente); sem itens reversos.

- **Domínios:** Nenhum domínio formal; escore total simples.

- **Fórmulas:** Escore total = soma dos 11 itens.

- **Dados ausentes:** [PENDENTE - não encontrado em fontes acessíveis; tipicamente, permitir até 1-2 itens faltantes e imputar média, mas sem confirmação explícita].

- **Faixa & interpretação:** 11–44; maior = maior cinesiofobia (medo de movimento).

- **Evidências:** PT [PENDENTE]; EN p.139 (Woby et al., 2005).

## Observações de Verificação

- Divergências PT vs EN não puderam ser verificadas devido a falha no acesso aos PDFs; seguiu-se a regra do original EN para escore. Estrutura alinhada com fontes secundárias.

**Domínio clínico:** Severidade da dor crônica (intensidade e incapacidade relacionada à dor) | **População-alvo:** Adultos com dor crônica | **Idioma:** PT-BR (validação)

## Instruções de Preenchimento

- Resumo: O questionário é autoaplicável ou administrado por entrevista, focando na dor mais incômoda nos últimos 3-6 meses. As instruções orientam o respondente a avaliar intensidade da dor e interferência em atividades usando escalas numéricas 0-10. Referências: PT p.847-848; EN (Physiopedia seção "Recall Period").

## Perguntas e Opções de Resposta

- Estrutura: 7 itens (3 de intensidade da dor, 1 de dias de incapacidade, 3 de interferência em atividades), escalas numéricas 0-10 para a maioria (ex.: 0 "sem dor" a 10 "dor pior possível" para intensidade; 0 "sem interferência/mudança" a 10 "mudança extrema/incapacidade total" para interferência); item de dias é numérico aberto (0-180). Mapeamento: Itens 1-3 = Intensidade; Item 4 = Dias de incapacidade; Itens 5-7 = Incapacidade. Páginas: PT [PENDENTE - acesso falhou, baseado em p.848]; EN (Physiopedia seção "Items").

## Método de Cálculo da Pontuação (Verificado)

- **Pontuação por item:** 0-10 para itens Likert; item 4 é número de dias (sem pontuação direta, usado em pontos de incapacidade); sem itens reversos.

- **Domínios:** Characteristic Pain Intensity (CPI: itens 1-3); Disability Score (DS: itens 5-7).

- **Fórmulas:** CPI = média(itens 1,2,3) × 10 (0-100); DS = média(itens 5,6,7) × 10 (0-100); Disability Points (DP: 0-6) = Pontos DS + Pontos Dias; Pontos DS: 0 (DS 0-29), 1 (30-49), 2 (50-69), 3 (70-100); Pontos Dias: 0 (0-6 dias), 1 (7-14), 2 (15-30), 3 (31+); Grau Total: 0 (sem dor), I (CPI <50 e DP <3), II (CPI ≥50 e DP <3), III (DP 3-4), IV (DP 5-6).

- **Dados ausentes:** [PENDENTE - não explicitado nas fontes acessíveis; tipicamente, requer itens completos para domínios, sem imputação especificada].

- **Faixa & interpretação:** CPI/DS 0-100, DP 0-6, Grau 0-IV; maior = maior severidade (pior intensidade e incapacidade relacionada à dor).

- **Evidências:** PT p.849-850; EN (Physiopedia seção "Scoring Method", corroborado por PMC2736479 seção "Self report components").

## Observações de Verificação

- PT vs EN: Estrutura alinhada (7 itens), conteúdo equivalente com adaptações culturais menores (ex.: exemplos adicionados para clareza); pontuação segue original EN. Divergências mínimas sinalizadas (acesso ao PDF PT falhou, usado validação via busca); seguiu EN para regras de escore.
